# 🖥️ Computer Vision (Crash Course) 🚀

Welcome to my Computer Vision (Crash Course) repository! This is a hands-on journey into the world of OpenCV and image processing as part of CPE 313 - Advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning | CPE32S3. Goal? To master the fundamentals of computer vision by working through six Python notebooks tackeling different fundemental OpenCV topics. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️📸

## 📌 Course Overview
Computer vision is all about teaching machines to see and understand images and videos. Through answering these notebooks, we explored essential techniques in image processing, edge detection, and face recognition using OpenCV.

## 📚 Topics Covered
Each notebook in this repository tackles a key aspect of OpenCV:
1️⃣ Basic I/O Scripting (Images) 🖼️ - Learn how to read, display, and manipulate images using OpenCV.
2️⃣ Basic I/O Scripting (Videos) 🎥 - Handle video streams, capture frames, and perform real-time processing.
3️⃣ Edge and Contour Detection 🔍 - Understand image gradients, detect edges, and identify contours in images.
4️⃣ Line and Circle Detection 🎯 - Use the Hough Transform to detect lines, circles, and geometric patterns.
5️⃣ Face Detection using OpenCV 🤖 - Implement face detection with OpenCV’s built-in classifiers.
6️⃣ Performing Face Recognition 🧠 - Recognize faces using machine learning techniques and deep learning models.

## 🎯 Learning Goals
By the end of this, you will:
✔️ Understand the fundamentals of OpenCV.
✔️ Perform image and video processing tasks.
✔️ Detect edges, contours, and geometric shapes.
✔️ Implement face detection and recognition systems.
✔️ Gain hands-on experience with real-world computer vision problems.
